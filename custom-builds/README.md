# Custom builds recipes

A collection of custom build setups, mostly for building directly on the cluster.

* A custom device registry – [custom-device-registry](/custom-device-registry)
* A custom protocol adapter – [custom-protocol-adapter](/custom-protocol-adapter)
* Using images from ImageStreams – [override-device-registry](/override-device-registry)

Although the directories are named after specific deployments, like "device registry", the
recipes may work with other components as well. The naming just based on my initial use case.
