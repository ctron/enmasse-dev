# EnMasse developer tools

This repository contains some personal tools, for working on [enmasse.io](http://enmasse.io).

## Eclipse

See [eclipse/](eclipse/ "Eclipse") for more information in how to work on
EnMasse using Eclipse as an IDE. Including some launch configurations.

## Scripts

See [scripts/](scripts/ "Scripts") for some helper scripts.

## Custom builds

The directory [custom-builds/](custom-builds/) provides a few recipes
for doing custom builds, mostly directly on the cluster, without the need
to use EnMasse build system.
