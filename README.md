# EnMasse developer tools

This repository contains some personal tools for working on [enmasse.io](http://enmasse.io).

## S2I â€“ source-to-image

Allows you to switch EnMasse to be built by "source to image".

With the operator model, this currently doesn't work.

## Eclipse Launch configurations

See [launch/](launch/ "Launch configurations").
